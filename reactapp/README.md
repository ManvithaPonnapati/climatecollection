**Climage Collection REACT UI**

The point of entry for the react app is the ../reactapp/index.js . index.js loads
the appropriate react component according to the routes defined in the ../reactapp/indexRoutes.js. For every route we load a component from ../reactapp/layouts folder. A layout in our app is equivalent to a HTML page layout. A layout can call a bunch of smaller components from the ../reactapp/components/ folder to make it a modular page.
